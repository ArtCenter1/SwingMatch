SwingMatch Technical Specifications Briefing
I. Executive Summary
SwingMatch is an innovative AI-powered mobile application designed to revolutionize tennis coaching by providing personalized stroke analysis, professional player comparisons, and AI-generated improvement simulations. The core objective is to democratize professional coaching by offering actionable, real-time feedback through advanced computer vision and machine learning. The application aims to be mobile-first, leveraging device capabilities for high-quality video capture while offloading computationally intensive AI processing to the cloud.
Key technical decisions consistently highlight a mobile-first approach with cloud-based AI processing for scalability and efficiency. There's a strong emphasis on asynchronous job processing for video analysis to improve user experience by preventing long waits. The most complex technical challenge across all specifications is the AI-generated swing correction simulation, requiring sophisticated video manipulation and deep learning models.
II. Core Functionality and Features
The application's core functionality revolves around a structured process of video recording, AI analysis, comparison, and simulation:

III. System Architecture and Technology Stack
The architecture is consistently envisioned as a mobile client interacting with a cloud-based microservices backend, emphasizing scalability, performance, and maintainability.
A. Architecture Overview
•
Mobile Application: The user-facing component, responsible for UI, video capture, playback, and communication with the backend. React Native is the overwhelmingly preferred framework for cross-platform development.
•
API Gateway: Serves as the entry point for all mobile app requests, handling authentication, routing, and rate limiting.
•
Microservices Backend: A set of independent services handling specific functionalities. Common services include:
◦
User Management Service: Authentication, user profiles, preferences.
◦
Video Processing Service: Handles video upload, compression, metadata extraction, and storage.

AI Analysis Engine/Worker: The core brain, performing pose estimation, stroke analysis, comparison, and simulation generation. This is often an asynchronous process.
◦
Content Management Service: Manages the professional player library and educational content.
◦
Notification Service: Manages push notifications.
•
Data Flow:
1.
User records video on mobile app.
2.
Video uploaded to cloud storage (typically S3) via pre-signed URLs to avoid proxying large files through the API server.
3.
Mobile app requests analysis from API Gateway.
4.
Backend queues an analysis job (e.g., SQS, Celery/RabbitMQ).
5.
AI workers/Lambda functions pick up jobs, download videos, perform analysis/simulation, and store results (JSON, new video).
6.
Results are updated in the database.
7.
User is notified via push notification when analysis is complete.

IV. Key Technical Challenges and Risks
Several critical challenges and risks are consistently identified across the specifications:
•
AI Model Accuracy and Quality:
◦
The primary technical risk is ensuring the accuracy of pose estimation and biomechanical analysis, and the perceptual quality and biomechanical realism of AI-generated simulation videos. "The 'stroke replacement' feature is high-risk. It may look uncanny or have artifacts." (Gemini).
◦
Mitigation involves "rigorous testing and fallback metrics" (Groke), "continuous model training and validation" (Claude), and potentially starting with "a simplified simulation (e.g., an animated overlay of the correct pose) and iterate" (Gemini).
•
Video Processing Scalability and Cost:
◦
Video analysis and generation are "computationally intensive" (Claude) and "can be slow and expensive" (Gemini).
◦
Mitigation includes using "cloud auto-scaling and optimization" (Claude), "serverless and inherently scalable" architectures (API Gateway, Lambda, SQS - Gemini), "efficient video compression and streaming" (Claude), and "optimizing the models (e.g., quantization)" (Gemini).
•
Large Video File Handling:
◦
Managing "large video file handling" (Claude) and "reliable, potentially chunked" uploads (Gemini) is crucial. Direct S3 uploads via pre-signed URLs are a common solution.
•
Data Privacy and Security Compliance:
◦
"Sensitive user video data requiring encryption" (Claude) and adherence to regulations like GDPR/CCPA are paramount.
◦
Mitigation involves "client-side encryption before upload" (Claude), "encryption at rest and in transit" (unanimous), and "user consent management" (Claude).
•
Sourcing Professional Player Data:
◦
"Sourcing high-quality, consistently shot pro videos is a challenge." (Gemini). This requires "professional player content licensing agreements" (Claude) or creating "our own 'ideal stroke' data" (Gemini).
V. Performance and Scalability Requirements
•
API Response Times: Generally targeted at <200-500ms for standard requests.
•
Video Upload: Progress indicators with targets like <30 seconds for 1-minute videos.
•
AI Analysis Completion: Critical target of <60 seconds to <5 minutes for stroke analysis. Simulation generation might be longer, with targets around <2 minutes to <10 minutes.
•
App Launch Time: <3 seconds cold start time.
•
Video Playback: <2 seconds initial load time with progressive loading.
•
Scalability Strategy:
◦
Horizontal Scaling of microservices and AI workers using Kubernetes/ECS/Fargate/Lambda auto-scaling.
◦
CDN for global video delivery and caching.
◦
Redis for caching frequently accessed data and results.

Database Read Replicas for high read loads.
◦
Video Compression and adaptive bitrate streaming.
VI. Security and Privacy Considerations
•
Authentication & Authorization: JWTs with refresh tokens, OAuth 2.0 integration, and role-based access control (RBAC). AWS Cognito, Auth0, and Firebase Auth are common choices.

Data Security:
◦
Encryption at Rest: AES-256 for all sensitive data in databases and S3 buckets.
◦
Encryption in Transit: TLS 1.2/1.3 for all API communications.
◦
PII Protection: Anonymization in analytics, user consent management, right to erasure (GDPR Article 17).
•
Application Security: Input validation, SQL injection prevention (via ORMs), XSS prevention, security headers (CSP, HSTS). Regular security scanning and penetration testing.
VII. User Interface and Experience (UI/UX)
While detailed UI specifications vary, common themes emerge:
•
Design Principles: Clarity, performance, accessibility, consistency, modern, energetic, professional, and approachable.
•
Color System: Tennis-inspired palettes often featuring blues, greens (for tennis courts/balls), and oranges. A clear semantic color system (success, warning, error) and neutral palette for backgrounds. Dark mode is a consideration.
•
Typography: Emphasis on readable sans-serif fonts (Inter, Roboto, SF Pro) with clear type scales and weights.
•
Interactive Elements: High-contrast, rounded buttons with clear feedback. Skeleton screens and circular progress indicators for loading states.
