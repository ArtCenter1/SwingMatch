## **1. Overview & Problem Context**

**Product Summary**\
SwingMatch is a mobile application designed to elevate tennis training and social interaction through AI-powered stroke analysis and community-driven match play features. It empowers players of all levels to improve their technique using advanced video analysis, professional comparisons, and personalized improvement simulations. Simultaneously, it fosters connection by enabling players to find local match partners and engage in a gamified social ecosystem.

**User Needs**\
Users seek:

- Affordable, accessible, and objective coaching
- Clear, data-backed feedback on strokes
- Progress visualization
- Match pairing with similar-level players
- A social experience around tennis

**Problem Context**\
Traditional coaching is expensive and fragmented. Existing apps fail to unify training and community into one seamless, data-driven experience.

### **Immediate Priority: High-Fidelity Clickable Prototype**

- **Objective:** Develop a high-fidelity, clickable prototype that demonstrates the core user flow of video capture, AI analysis, and simulation.
- **Purpose:** Secure early user feedback, validate the core value proposition, and support the next round of funding.
- **Scope:** The prototype will be non-functional on the backend but will accurately represent the final UI/UX. It must fully implement the established design tokens, color themes, and component library to ensure the user flow can be tested with perfect fidelity before any functional backend development begins.
